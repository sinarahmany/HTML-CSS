            <h1 class="title">Biography</h1>
            <p>Martijn Gerard Garritsen is a Dutch musician, record producer, and DJ whose music is typically categorised in ‘progressive house’, ‘electro house’, big room house’, and ‘future bass’ genres. Professionally known as Martin Garrix (stylized version Mar+in Garri×) and also as GRX, Garritsen began playing guitar at the early age of eight. Deeply influenced by the fellow Dutch DJ Tiësto and his performance at the opening ceremony of 2004 Athens Olympics, Garritsen downloaded ‘digital audio workstation’ and ‘FL Studio’, and taught himself how to compose tracks. Discovered by Tiësto a few years later, he has also collaborated with the likes of AfroJack, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Dillion Francis, Usher, Julian Jordan and Troye Sivan. His career was launched with Spinnin' Records. In 2016 he created his own label ‘STMPD RCRDS’ and signed with Sony Music. He is set to appear for a summer residency at Hï Ibiza’ club in 2017. He was ranked at the No. 1 spot on the DJ Mag’s list of top 100 DJs of the world in 2016.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Bylaw EP.</h1>
            <p>This is the last album realsed by Martin Garrix <br>
            	Martin Garrix caps off ADE week with the fifth and final release from his new EP, now revealed to be named BYLAW. <br>

The five-track compilation is the long-awaited release of the music we have heard Garrix feature in his sets this festival season. The final track of the week is titled “Waiting for Tomorrow,” and it’s unlikely that Garrix enthusiasts haven’t been listening to a bootleg version of the song since Garrix started performing it in 2015. The collaboration with Pierce Fulton was feared to never be released, but three years later, it’s finally here. <br>

The track features vocals by Linkin Park‘s Mike Shinoda, adding a new dynamic and contrasting from the pop-leaning vocals of many of the producer’s recent releases. The collaboration is also not without a good story, as Pierce Fulton posted on his Instagram the story about how the track came to be.
<br>

            Tracklist: <br>
Breach (Walk Alone) <br>
Yottabyte <br>
Latency <br>
Access <br>
The EP is fully out now on Garrix’s own STMPD Records. </p>
